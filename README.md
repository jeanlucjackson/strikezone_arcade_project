# StrikeZone: Arcade '21
Welcome to the pitching game based on real-life pitcher data!

## Objective
The goal of the game is to avoid being pulled by your manager. The player begins with
3 Mound Visits and loses one each time the manager comes to speak to you about your
performance. The player earns points by achieving pitcher-friendly outcomes such as
Strikeouts and In Play Outs and loses points by letting batter-friendly outcomes
happen such as Walks, base hits, and Hit By Pitches.

## Instructions
The game provides guidance on user-inputs. As a command line game, the primary form
of interaction is through text-based inputs. Pitch commands are inputted as:
\[Pitch Type\]\[Strikezone Zone\], such as "F3" for a Fastball in Zone 3.
